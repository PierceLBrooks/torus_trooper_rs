[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/arnodb/torus_trooper_rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/arnodb/torus_trooper_rs)

A rewrite of the original game from [ABA Games](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/) in Rust.

## WTF?
The purpose of this work is to learn Rust and especially techniques to remove what is sometimes called the "sea of objects".

This is a work in progress, there is still a lot to do and to learn.
